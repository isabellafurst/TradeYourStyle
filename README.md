# TradeYourStyle
CS 304 Project

Our goal with our project TradeYourStyle is to offer a range of features designed to streamline the process of both trading and giving away old clothing. Since the end-of-year sustainability bins in dorm spaces are often cluttered and difficult to navigate, TradeYourStyle offers an organized and year-round opportunity for students to share, trade, and find new clothing or accessories in a sustainable and easy way. Through this platform, students can list items they donâ€™t need and connect with other Wellesley students in the community who are interested in exchanging items or receiving them. 
TradeYourStyle centers around a homepage with a main feed of listings, which allows users to browse, filter by attributes like item type or size, and navigate searching for items using a traditional search bar. Each user will also have their own page displaying their own listings, making it simpler for potential traders to explore similar items. Similarly, there will be a messaging feature implemented to streamline communication between users.
